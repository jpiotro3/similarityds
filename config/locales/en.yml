    The goal of this site is to gather data on how people define similarity
    between images. We want to be able to tell what data comes from a single
    person. That's why we ask you to register and then log in before starting
    data collection. The data will be anonymised, so there will be no way to
    tie your personal data with image similarity data. Your e-mail will never
    be shared with anynone and your personal data will never passed to anyone.
    We require e-mail for the sole purpose of password recovery.
